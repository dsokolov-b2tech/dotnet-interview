You are designing a system for an e-commerce platform that processes customer orders. 


When a customer places an order, the system must:
 - Save the order details in a database.
 - Send a message to a notification service to inform the customer that their order has been received.


The system must ensure that both the order is saved and the notification is sent reliably, 
even in the face of failures (e.g., database crashes, network issues, or service downtime).
